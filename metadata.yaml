description: "Summer is a novel by Edith Wharton published in 1917 by Charles Scribner's\
  \ Sons. The story is one of only two novels to be set in New England by Wharton,\
  \ who was best known for her portrayals of upper-class New York society. The novel\
  \ details the sexual awakening of its protagonist, Charity Royall, and her cruel\
  \ treatment by the father of her child, and shares many plot similarities with Wharton's\
  \ better-known novel, Ethan Frome. Only moderately well received when originally\
  \ published, Summer has had a resurgence in critical popularity since the 1960s.\n\
